### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python


```python
This a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
```


      Cell In[7], line 1
        This a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
             ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax




```python
This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
200 minutes into hours
```


      Cell In[9], line 1
        This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
             ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
